                        When a teacher asked a class of 50 students of 10th
                        grade about what they want to become in future, 20
                        replied they want to become engineers. 10 of them wanted
                        to become doctors. 8 of them wanted to become actors
                        while 7 of them wanted to be teachers. The remaining 5
                        were unsure about what they wanted to do in their
                        life.<br />
                        Exactly after 15 years, 16 people of that class are
                        engineers, 7 are doctors, 8 are entrepreneurs, 10 are
                        teachers, while the rest of them are writers,
                        photographers, and salesmen. None of them went on to
                        become an actor.<br />
                        What’s the moral of the story? The career paths of
                        people tend to change over the course of time. It may
                        happen that a person who wanted to pursue a different
                        career at a point of time, later came to know that
                        he/she is not happy doing what he/she always wanted to
                        do. It’s very common for people to end up doing
                        something with which they’re not happy.<br />
                        Today, we have “Career Assessment Tests” which can help
                        your child or student avoid such situations. In many
                        developed countries like the United States of America
                        (USA) and Australia, these tests have gained huge
                        acceptance among the students. However, in India,
                        there’s still a lack of awareness about the career
                        assessment test, its importance, and its effectiveness.

                        Selecting the right career for himself/herself can be
                        tough for your child. He/she doesn't know whether the
                        career path he/she wants to take at the present moment
                        will give him/her happiness in the future or not. A
                        career assessment test helps a student in knowing about
                        himself/herself and various career options in depth.
                        These tests generally comprise a series of Multiple
                        Choice Questions (MCQs). Sometimes, the students may
                        also be asked to answer a few subjective type questions.

                        psychologists to help the students understand themselves
                        better. By giving these tests, your child will be able
                        to evaluate his/her strengths, weaknesses, passion,
                        perception, interests, and ambitions. By knowing these

                        a suitable career for himself or herself.<br />
                        The answers provided by your child during a career
                        assessment test is evaluated by the experts to know
                        his/her strengths, weaknesses, interests, and is matched
                        with the requirements of different career options. This
                        way, the career counsellor is able to provide better
                        advice to your child about which career is more suitable
                        for him or her.<br /><br />

                        Effectiveness of career assessment test
                      </h4>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Are career assessment tests really effective? As a
                        parent or teacher, this might be a common question
                        lingering in your mind. The answer to this question is
                        pretty simple. To reach a goal, you need to have a clear
                        strategy or plan in place. You need to know your
                        strengths and weaknesses and choose the right vehicle
                        which can take you to your goal. Similarly, through a
                        career assessment test, a student gets to know himself
                        or herself in depth and hence, is able to create a
                        better strategy regarding his/her career. He or she will
                        be able to approach his/her dreams with more confidence
                        after knowing his/her strengths. And, by knowing his/her
                        weaknesses, he/she can alter or modify his/her strategy
                        so that he/she will have to face least obstacles in
                        reaching his/her career goals.
                        <br />
                        As per the studies and estimates, a career assessment
                        test plays 30 to 40 percent role in determining the
                        right career choice for a student.
