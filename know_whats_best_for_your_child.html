                      <p class="card-text">
                        In India, even before a child is born, parents start
                        dreaming about his or her career path. Some parents want
                        their kid to follow their footsteps, some place their
                        own unfulfilled aspirations on them, while others expect
                        their kids to take up a reputable profession. All in
                        all, career planning talks begin at a very nascent stage
                        in a child’s life.
                        <br />Irrespective of what ultimately a parent is able
                        to provide their child with, every parent wishes the
                        best for their child. That being said, are all parents
                        equipped to navigate through the tricky process of
                        identifying a child’s true calling? The honest answer is
                        no.<br />
                        However, there’s no reason to fret. In today’s day and
                        age, the challenging task of helping students chart out
                        their career paths can be handed over to dedicated
                        career counsellors. Let us dive deeper into what career
                        counselling is all about and why it holds the importance
                        that it does.

                        What is Career Counselling?
                      </h4>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Education is one of the most crucial aspects of one’s
                        overall growth and development. Each child’s academic
                        life involves certain milestone decisions. The 10th and
                        the 12th grades are landmark years in your child’s life.
                        Just like every other student, your child will also be
                        faced with the irony of having a million opportunities
                        to pursue as career options but on the flipside, he/she
                        will have an opportunity to make an appropriate
                        selection from amongst the many available options at a
                        tender young age. <br />
                        Not all children are equipped to take all these
                        important decisions by themselves. Your child may need
                        the involvement of the elders in his or her life-
                        parents, teachers, and in today’s times, career or
                        guidance counsellors. Career counselling is a process
                        that aims at enabling a child to identify his or her
                        true passions, interests and skill-set and bring them
                        together in such a way that the child can convert these
                        into money-making prospects in the future.

                      </h4>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Today’s kids have a fresh, spirited and balanced
                        perspective about their future work-life. They are more
                        likely to exhibit strong tastes in diverse areas of
                        interest. You may have noticed that from early on, your
                        child’s curious mind must have led him or her to explore
                        hobbies, pursue vocations or develop a penchant for
                        certain academic subjects. These interests lay the
                        foundation for your child’s future career. <br />
                        An inclusive career plan would be incomplete without
                        taking into consideration your child’s primary
                        interests. However, it wouldn’t be false to say that
                        these interests may not always prove to be viable career
                        options.<br />
                        Another important aspect of consideration in your
                        child's career plan is understanding where his or her
                        true capabilities reside. Your child's potential must be
                        understood to identify which skills can be honed from a
                        young age with the aim to be perfected. Career
                        counsellors offer various tests that help measure a
                        child's aptitude, which cover essential points like
                        logical reasoning and soft skills.

                        Although today’s children are extremely proactive when
                        it comes to them preparing for their future goals, not
                        all kids have the clarity and awareness to chart out a
                        path for themselves. This is another area where career
                        counselling adds tremendous value. Career counsellors
                        are adept at handling the normal confusion and doubts
                        that young adults face. They also have the tact to
                        gently draw out answers from your children about their
                        true calling without overwhelming them - a skill that
                        parents may lack.
